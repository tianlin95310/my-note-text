加速度传感器
Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER:
All values are in SI units (m/s^2) 
	values[0]: Acceleration minus Gx on the x-axis 
	values[1]: Acceleration minus Gy on the y-axis 
	values[2]: Acceleration minus Gz on the z-axis 

Examples: 
	When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed on its left side toward the right, the x acceleration value is positive. 
	When the device lies flat on a table, the acceleration value is +9.81, which correspond to the acceleration of the device (0 m/s^2) minus the force of gravity (-9.81 m/s^2). 
	When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed toward the sky with an acceleration of A m/s^2, the acceleration value is equal to A+9.81 which correspond to the acceleration of the device (+A m/s^2) minus the force of gravity (-9.81 m/s^2). 

// 光传感器
Sensor.TYPE_LIGHT:
	values[0]: Ambient light level in SI lux units 

// 距离传感器
Sensor.TYPE_PROXIMITY: 
	values[0]: Proximity sensor distance measured in centimeters 

	values[0]: Azimuth, angle between the magnetic north direction and the y-axis, around the z-axis (0 to 359). 0=North, 90=East, 180=South, 270=West 
values[1]: Pitch, rotation around x-axis (-180 to 180), with positive values when the z-axis moves toward the y-axis. 
values[2]: Roll, rotation around the x-axis (-90 to 90) increasing as the device moves clockwise. 
Note: This definition is different from yaw, pitch and roll used in aviation where the X axis is along the long side of the plane (tail to nose). 
Note: This sensor type exists for legacy reasons, please use getRotationMatrix() in conjunction with remapCoordinateSystem() and getOrientation() to compute these values instead. 
Important note: For historical reasons the roll angle is positive in the clockwise direction (mathematically speaking, it should be positive in the counter-clockwise direction). 
android.hardware.Sensor.TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR:
Identical to android.hardware.Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR except that it doesn't use the geomagnetic field. Therefore the Y axis doesn't point north, but instead to some other reference, that reference is allowed to drift by the same order of magnitude as the gyroscope drift around the Z axis. 
In the ideal case, a phone rotated and returning to the same real-world orientation will report the same game rotation vector (without using the earth's geomagnetic field). However, the orientation may drift somewhat over time. See android.hardware.Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR for a detailed description of the values. This sensor will not have the estimated heading accuracy value.
